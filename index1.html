				<p> Tongariro was New Zealand's first national park. The mountain
				peaks of Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu were a gift from Ngati
				Tuwharetoa in 1887. This was 15 years after the world's first 
				national park, Yellowstone was created in the United States </p>
				
				<p>National parks are places set aside to
				protect natural landscapes and native plants and animals forever
				They are really big - 10,000 hectares or more, Protection comes first 
				but they are also places for people to enjoy. GO visit some of them- 
				just dont damage them, We also have underwater national parks - they 
				are called marine reserves</p>
